# Informational Report on Life Expectancy 
## Objective 
This project investigates the key factors influencing life expectancy in developed and developing countries, providing actionable recommendations for countries with low life expectancy. 
## Questions(KPIs)
- Does Schooling  affect Life expectancy?
- Does the adult mortality rate have an impact on life expectancy?
- Does life expectancy have a positive or negative correlation with certain lifestyles such as drinking alcohol? 
-	What impact does Immunization against Diphtheria and Polio have on life expectancy?
- What are the effects of  HIV/AIDS on life expectancy?
- Should countries below the Average life expectancy increase their Healthcare expenditure to improve their  average lifespan?
- Interactive Dashboard <a href= https://github.com/Comfort-del/Life-Expectancy/blob/main/Life%20Expectany%20Dashboard.pbix>View Dashboard</a>
## Process
- Change null values to zero
- Remove countries with only one year's record data.
- Replace the null value with the mean in 2013 for Poland.

## Project Insight
- Developed countries have higher life expectancy than developing countries.
- Schooling has a positive correlation with life expectancy, the percentage of schooling is higher in developed countries.
- As alcohol consumption increases, life expectancy decreases. Muslim countries have low alcohol consumption maybe due to their culture against alcohol.
- Immunization has a positive correlation with life expectancy. A country's life expectancy is influenced by the number of  people immunized. 
- The number of HIV/AIDS deaths in a country affects its life expectancy.
## Recommendation
-  Developed countries tend to have a higher schooling rate, and their higher economic  values showed a positive relationship with their healthcare needs.  Hence it is assumed that these countries invest in their economic returns in these areas.
- Developing countries having higher  mortality rates should tailor their resources to their health sector, and then their life expectancy is expected to increase over time.
- Developed countries should patronage schooling. As when people are educated they tend to live healthier lifestyles.
